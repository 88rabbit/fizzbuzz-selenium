Read Me v1.1: Updated by Ashwin


Created small project to validate title of NFL score page. Looks like NFL score page title is "NFL Football Scores - NFL Scoreboard - ESPN - ESPN" instead of "NFL Scoreboard", so have used former one for validation.

Integration with Travis CI is done. KIndly review the project code and let me know for your comments.

Thanks,
Ashwin
